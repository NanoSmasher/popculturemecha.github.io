<p><!--more-->So this is a quick page on how I score things, or rather, what my scores mean relative to each other.  For me, it isn't quite a linear fit.  For me, the difference between a score of 3 and 4 is a lot smaller than the difference between a score of 7 and 8.  Here, this graph will illustrate what I'm talking about.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-141" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/chartgo.png" alt="ChartGo" width="300" height="450" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As you can see, it's weird.  However, this should give you a basic idea of what the difference between my scores are.  If I chose to give something a 7 instead of a 6 or 8, it's because I've put some thought into it and that's where I've sort of set my line for what constitutes an average or good-ish anime.  For me, 8 is great and 6 is meh.  Below 6, the scores tend to not matter because I thought the show wasn't worth my time, and above 8, it means either the show itself is amazing, or it touched me personally, or both.  Whatever the case may be, it's awesome as far as I'm concerned.  As subjective as that may sound, that's just the way it is.</p>
