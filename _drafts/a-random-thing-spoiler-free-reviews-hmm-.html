<p><!--more-->So, I was in the process of writing my review of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (which will come out some time soon, probably).  A thought came to me, as they sometimes do: can one possibly write a spoiler-free review?  I thought this was an important question, seeing as how I, every now and then, do write reviews.  Of what quality they are, I cannot say with 100% confidence, although if the visitation at my online establishment is any indication, then I may have to reconsider my technique.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, whether I or anyone else can truly write a spoiler-free review was an intriguing enough query to force me to write a whole 'nother post on it, so there.</p>
<p>So first, what qualifies as "spoiler-free".  Well, there's definitely an element of plot in there, in fact that's the first thing you think of, isn't it?  At least, this is true for those of you who look for reviews before, or in order to decide whether you will, consume a particular item of media.  If you have already seen/read/played something, the idea of spoiler-free usually has little to no meaning (unless it's something like a gaming review that reveals particular features of the game that you did not previously know if, say, you hadn't finished the game 100%).  So first, we have plot.  Logically, spoiler-free reviews would spoil... nothing as to the plot, whether it be event-by-event narrative, or specific moments, or even the presence of certain characters.</p>
<p>That's another one.  Characters may or may not be considered alongside plot when thinking of what qualifies as spoiler-free.  I mean, if they're on the poster... yeah, nothing one can really do there.  What about characters that you didn't know were going to be in it?  Yeah, that's probably a good thing to not mention, right?  Can you at least mention that there are other characters, not as yet mentioned in casting rumours etc., who play a large role in the telling of the story?  It's an interesting question, since that might start people's minds thinking.  "Who could it be, this mysterious character?  Oh, it could be ___ or ___ or even ___ from ____", and thus more and more rumours begin.  It's that fear of the over-bearing and overly-willing to share nerd fan-base of things that may prevent you from doing that.</p>
<p>In fact, that fear pretty much runs completely contrary to the point of even writing a review in the first place.  Think about it, just about everything in a review can result in an engendering of the opinion of the reader.  If you say your opinion on something, people have a potential to be swayed by that opinion.  This is especially true for people who have not already seen/heard/read/played what it is that you are reviewing.  They can't have an immediate response to your opinion, be it agreeing or disagreeing,</p>
