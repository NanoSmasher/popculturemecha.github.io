<p>Let's take a stroll...</p>
<p><!--more-->Let's cut to the chase: it's a new regular feature on the site.  I give you my idea of a great OST for a particular situation.  I really like music, but I have a lot more anime music on me than... other music.  That isn't to say I haven't listened to a lot of other music.  I just listen to... a lot of music from anime.  So I will have both an anime edition and a normal edition of lists, and I will specify what version of the OST I am doing.  It will be clear very quickly what type of list it is though.</p>
