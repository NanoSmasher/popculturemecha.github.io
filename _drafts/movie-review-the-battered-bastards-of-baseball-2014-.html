<p>Alright, here's a quick and dirty review of this quick and dirty documentary on the Portland Mavericks, an independent baseball team that flourished in a time and place that was just right for it.</p>
<p><!--more-->Everyone loves baseball.  That's just sort of a thing.  It's a game with all the trappings of greatness: it requires insane physical ability, terrific teamwork, and an ability to stand firm in clutch situations.  But at the end of the day, it's just a game.  A game that people love to watch and love to play.</p>
<p>But what happens when it stops being just a game?  What happens when it becomes business?  Can you lose your love for something if it becomes tainted by material avarice?</p>
<p>This is one of the core questions asked in the 2014 Netflix-produced documentary "The Battered Bastards of Baseball", that tells the legendary story of the Portland Mavericks, the only independent baseball team to exist in the mid 1970's, in a time when Major League baseball system had control of every other professional group of players.</p>
<p>Bing Russell, father of actor Kurt Russell, and a moderately famous actor himself, was a huge baseball fan.  He was a scholar of the game, even going so far as to make long exams/questionnaires and instructional videos (filmed with a young Kurt) on how the game should be played.  Bing's love of baseball came as a result of his rich baseball upbringing, as he was often playing around</p>
