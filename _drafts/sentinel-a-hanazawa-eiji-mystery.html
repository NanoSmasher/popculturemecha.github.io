<p>When the cheerful English teacher Ms. Sakurako finds herself under the gaze of a stalker, she asks Eiji to come to her aid.  While Eiji agrees, he can't help but feel that something, or someone, is playing a role in the background.  Are Eiji's instincts correct?  Can Eiji discover them before it's too late?  Find out in <em>Sentinel: A Hanazawa Eiji Mystery</em>!</p>
