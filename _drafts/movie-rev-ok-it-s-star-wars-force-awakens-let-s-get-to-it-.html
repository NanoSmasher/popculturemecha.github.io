<p>Ain't got no time for exposition, it's Star Wars.  Also, SPOILERS DEAD AHEAD, EVASIVE MANEUVERS!!  Hell, I basically retell the entire movie.</p>
<p><!--more-->I grew up on Star Wars.  It's not bragging, just letting you know.  That's enough exposition.  Let's move on.</p>
<p>Ok, Star Wars.  What is there to say?  The Force Awakens... was decent.  As a movie, it was... alright.  And as a fan, I am... reminded.</p>
<p>Ok look, one's opinion on Star Wars: The Force Awakens really comes down to one thing: do you like callbacks? Do you like nostalgia pulls?  Do you enjoy "feels" for the sake of "feels"?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you most likely enjoyed Force Awakens.</p>
<p>I... am indifferent to those questions, my answer for all intents and purposes is that I don't mind them.  Most likely those who look at me strangely when I say that the Force Awakens was okay probably answered a resounding HELL YEAH to any or all of the above questions.  Because let's be completely and utterly honest ('cause why not?), THIS MOVIE WAS TRYING WAY TOO HARD TO PLEASE!!!!</p>
<p>Let's take a moment to review the plot, shall we?</p>
<p>Start off with a daring rebel on a mission to retrieve and return very important information to their superiors when, all of a sudden, they are overtaken by a overbearing, ruthless group of antagonists, led by a "hot under the mask" member of the dark side.  In all of the rush, the daring rebel hands off the sensitive information to an enthusiastic droid who is sent running by his owner into the sandy landscape.</p>
<p>The poor droid is rescued by the unlikeliest of heroes, a scavenger child who was abandoned on that planet as a young girl and who now tries to survive day to day until the time final comes when the plot finally becomes original.  Should be any day now, but her hope wears thin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the daring rebel is being tortured by the Rick Moranis stunt-double.  Since this type of torture wouldn't have worked in the original trilogy, they invented the Sith equivalent of blood-bending in order to make the character seem like more of a threat. Thusly, he is able to extract the general location of the sensitive information (it's in a droid on a planet.  Oh dear, they're hot on the trail now.)</p>
<p>The daring rebel (hereby know as TDR), is rescued by a tormented, brain-washed storm trooper who doesn't know why he is doing what is doing besides the fact that he is doing it and it is the thing he should be doing.  Way to do it!  Their madcap escape ends poorly for them though, as they crash on the planet that the TDR was originally one before he got kidnapped.  They were headed there to find the droid he had left behind.  The storm trooper survives, but he sees the wreckage sink into the sand, so he believes that the only redeeming part of this movie has already died.  Thus, he dejectedly starts stripping... off his armor so that he can traverse the landscape in search of greener (lol) pastures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the droid has escaped into the arms of a scavenger with a bloody British accent.  The poor lil' poppinjay has been stranded all on 'er lonesome ever since she was a wee lass.  She 'opes to be rescued one day, but in the meantime she gallivants the flotsam of destroyed Star Destroyers lookin' for a decent shiny bobbet to trade in to the merchant outside of town.  Bloody sad whip, I might add.</p>
<p>Sorry about that, I think I ate too much bangers and mash.  Let's continue.  The droid decides to stick with the future queen of Euro Disney until they spot the sad (yet, not naked) storm trooper, who happens to be wearing the jacket of the TDR that he had found at the wreckage.  Presumably, he wasn't feeling hot enough already.  The droid commands Queen Euro Disney to hunt down the tired, sweaty person and she sticks him... with her lance.  I can't do anything with that.</p>
<p>After some explanations, everything is fine.  The trio are chased by a bunch more storm troopers, leading the group to jump into the nearest transport and zoom away.  Oh, sorry?  You're saying there was something important about that last part?  Nope, can't recall a thing.  Oh wait, there was one thing.  That battle in the wreckage between the Tie Fighter and their random ship was genuinely intense.  Yup, that's probably what you were talking about.</p>
<p>Anywhoddles, we now find the trio floating out in space in their hunk of junk, until they are captured in what seems to be an enemy vessel.  It is revealed that the ship is actually owned by a very, very old man who is looking for his last paycheck, and he believes that it is aboard their ship.  As protection, he has brought along his overprotective bathroom mat.  Don't laugh, that mat has an itchy trigger finger.</p>
<p>Queen Euro Disney (here on known as QED, which is unintentionally really apt) and a lifelike John Boyega cardboard cutout with lifelike perspiration convince the senile man to join them on their crusade to throw their droid at the enemy, thus ending them in one fell swoop.  He likes the idea and so he decides to help them.  However, it is to their dismay that they realize that the old man is already in a pinch with two different insurance companies, who he has been conning in order to gather funds to start his own shady Snake Oil business.  The result is a fistfight that ends in a very wet sloppy kiss in hyperspace.  Ask and thee shall receive.</p>
<p>The old man guides the group to a rest home in Boca Raton, where a wizened orange peel voiced by a</p>
