<p><!--more-->Last night, via his Pinterest account, Michael Bay made it clear to his fanbase that he was sick of the continued rumors circulating on the internet that he was in talks to direct or co-direct various upcoming anime, specifically entries in the Gundam franchise.</p>
<p>In the weeks following the announcement of the newest Gundam entry set to release this October, <em>Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans</em>, the internet was abuzz with rumors that Michael Bay was set to co-direct alongside Tatsuyuki Nagai.</p>
<p>The "news" was broken by <a href="http://www.animemaru.com/michael-bay-to-direct-new-gundam-anime/">Anime Maru</a> and almost immediately it was picked up by various other news outlets, despite having a quote from Nagai where he stated that quote, "We haven’t produced a decent Gundam show in years and if you’re going to make a sprawling toy commercial you might as well bring in a professional. I mean, did you even watch <em>Reconguista</em>?"  Despite this obviously falsified quote, people were seemingly convinced by the article.</p>
<p>Michael Bay is only one of a great number of popular Hollywood directors who have been rumored to have ties to anime-related projects.  For example, Guillermo del Toro has been rumored to be in the running to create a <em>Monster</em> adaptation series on HBO.  Another example is the much lesser known Uwe Boll attempted Kickstarter for a live-action <em>Lucky Star</em> adaptation headlined by an all African-American cast.  These various rumors have indeed stretched from the realm of the interesting to that of the absurd.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for reading, although this story was only slightly fake.  The Anime Maru article is real, but there has been little to no response from Mr. Bay about any of the rumors that have surfaced.  The Uwe Boll thing was completely bullsh*t though.  Have a great day!</p>
