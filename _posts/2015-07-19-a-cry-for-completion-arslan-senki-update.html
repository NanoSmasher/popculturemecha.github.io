<p><!--more-->This is just a very, very small update regarding something I didn't talk about in the last "Cry for Completion" involving the current status of translation and publication of the <em>Arslan Senki</em> series of novels.</p>
<p>The novel series is currently sitting at Volume 14 in the original Japanese.  Aaaaaaaand... no one has officially licensed the novels to translate and release them in English.  God damnit!</p>
<p>There are a few positive points though.  First, the Arakawa Hiromu manga adaptation <strong>has</strong> been licensed by Kodansha USA and it has currently released 3 translated volumes.  Second, the anime adaptation is currently out and Funimation has the license for that.  Hooray!  Although it's a bit second-hand, this adaptation is turning out to be a pretty nice story.  Nothing to complicated or unforeseen, but the animation quality and character chemistry make for a nice 2-cour show.  Again, I hold out little hope for a completely satisfying conclusion, but I do hope that they show some indication at the end that there will be future <em>Arslan</em> animes.</p>
<p>For those who are impatient (like me) or are more interested in taking a look at the original work (like me), then there is one option.  There's a fan translation available here: <a href="https://arslansenki.wordpress.com/">https://arslansenki.wordpress.com/</a>.  This guy is reeeeeeeeeally slow, but very good.  He is translating the Chinese translation of the original works (as there does exist a Chinese translation of the original Japanese novels) into English and uploading as time permits.  If you are interested, you can give that a shot.  I believe he last updated in June.  I wish him luck, as it is a hefty challenge to sift through the historical references of <em>Arslan</em>.  However, I definitely hope he succeeds.</p>

<p>That's all for the update.  Tune in for more crying at a later date.  Thanks again, and have a great day!</p>
