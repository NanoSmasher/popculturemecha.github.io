<p><!--more-->Heyo!  I've been watching a lot of movies instead of posting regularly, and the result is that this blog looks like it has seen better days (and it has).  That being said, let's get right to it.  Here's some more content, in the form of a review of Takashi Miike's 2010 samurai action epic, <em>13 Assassins</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1681" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/13-assassins.jpg" alt="13-assassins" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>When the corrupt and despotic relative of the shogun commits an unspeakable action against an ally, the wise adviser to the shogunate recruits a trusted samurai to pull together a band of assassins to murder him on the eve of his return to the shogun's side.  If they fail, not only will they be branded traitors and executed, the shogun will continue to be influenced by his relative, which would lead to the inevitable doom of the country.  The samurai must succeed, for the fate of the country is at hand.</p>
<p>Miike is no stranger to the action flick, but he's obviously out of his mind when it comes to crafting violence and morbid material.  Despite <em>13 Assassins</em> being a remake, Miike's macabre tendencies find a way to creep in, with many a graphic scene shown rather candidly.  Nothing strange there though, Miike does what Miike does.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1682" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/54677d3a349fdea646b9a3256706b67f.jpg" alt="54677d3a349fdea646b9a3256706b67f" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Somewhat reminiscent of <em>Seven Samurai</em> in it's battle organization and choreography, <em>13 Assassins</em> is really groomed to be a big screen movie, with wide angle shots and nifty camerawork all put together around a stunning and compelling set.  The way in which they made the movie adds enormously to the content, which is actually pretty linear.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1683" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/13_assassins2.jpg" alt="13_assassins2" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Given it's material, this film does deserve the praise it gets, and while it is not his deepest and most fleshed out work, the attention to detail and fast-pace make the run time feel a lot shorter than it is (although 14o minutes is still pretty short).  I would definitely recommend a watch if you haven't already.  It's a cool action movie at the very least, and it has enough samurai stuff to give you your bushido fix.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and have a great day!</p>
