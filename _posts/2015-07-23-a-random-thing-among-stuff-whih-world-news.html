<p><!--more-->Marvel's done a lot of weird things.  I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but if I could, this sentence would've been a good place to put them.  I just thought that this would be a better introduction to the post than, "Hi there!".</p>
<p>Anyways, yeah.  Marvel.  Real weirdo's over there.  However, one of the strangest things that I saw only recently was their viral campaign to promote <em>Ant-Man</em>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtJkDqZzoOFYbqwOIFn2Lng">WHIH World News Youtube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Remember Christine Everhart?  You should.  She was Robert Downey Jr.'s first lay in <em>Iron Man</em>, the first Iron Man movie.  She was introduced in that movie as a reporter from Vanity Fair magazine (Magazine?  Can you tell how old this movie is?), but on this Youtube channel she is a newscaster for WHIH World News.  There are only 5 videos uploaded on the channel as of the time I'm writing this post, and they seem to cover the time right before <em>Ant-Man</em>, and it clarifies how the movie fits into the timeline of the other Marvel movies, specifically tied to <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>.</p>
<p>It's a rather strange sight, because I don't think Marvel has done anything like this.  It's actually a big surprise to me that these videos haven't actually caught on with more hardcore fans of the MCU.  One of the best parts of the universe that Marvel has adapted from comics to silver screen is fluidity of it.  Because Marvel has decided to play fast and loose with the canon of the original work(s), they have the ability to do just about whatever they want to invent, manipulate, publicize and sell the ideas that make up the comics.  Marvel's big idea is that the stuff that makes up comics shouldn't be insular, and can be made easily accessible to anyone, irrespective of their experience with comic books.  Even the most ardent of DC fans can respect the strides that Marvel have taken, and they'll have to admit that what Marvel has done is something that DC has failed to do.  Example?  Zac Snyder's <em>Watchmen</em> was his idea of an adaptation of the famed comic of the same name.  It seemed like it was an attempt at capture every moment of the book frame-by-frame, and as a result it lost a lot of the meaning that was held in the interstices of the book.  There were many parts of the book that couldn't be adapted, such as the excerpts from autobiographies or the excerpts from other comic books, as these would not translate well to the screen and would confuse the audience.  Plus, if you try to adapt every last bit of the book, you'll just run out of time.  I wish somebody would've told that to Peter Jackson.  Marvel understood that trying to recreate everything scene-by-scene was a meaningless task, and so they just tried to work with the raw materials (the characters), and stay true to the big aspects of the movies, replacing some graphic novel nuances with action film cliches.  The result?  Big, big money at the box office.</p>
<p>Wait, what was I talking about again?  Oh right, this Youtube channel.  Anyways, because Marvel has made a very fluid universe, their ability to publicize is huge.  They can make up their own canon.  Christine Everhart can cover a story from two movies, thus publicizing them both, while also catching fans up on the timeline of events in anticipation of future films.  Thus, the third film is publicized, <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>.  By the way, I'll probably be doing a post entirely on that some time soon.  Man, do I have some thoughts about that one.</p>
<p>Anyways, I thought this was a rather weird thing from Marvel, seemingly out of the blue, but an interesting idea nonetheless to turn press into fake news.  I was also surprised that it has so few subscribers and views.  Usually anything Marvel touches turns to gold.  I guess they can't be right every time.  Look at <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>.</p>
<p>Well, that's all for now folks.  Thanks for reading, and if you have any thoughts of your own on this, please put them in the comments below.  Thanks again, and have a great day!</p>
