<p><!--more-->Hiya!  Here's another music review.  This times, it's on Last Alliance, a band that is pretty much your average j-rock band.  They aren't very stand-out among the other music I've listened to, but they still have some great songs.</p>
<p>Let's get started right off with one of Last Alliance's anime songs.  This is their opening for <em>Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Honestly, there isn't much to say when it comes to Last Alliance.  They are pretty straightforward as far as bands go.  They have various styles of song, but in general, their sound stays pretty constant.  There's always an underlying "rock" feeling to it, with the guitar and drum holding the major roles.  I'd say they are probably the most similar to the average American rock band.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Here's another example of what I mean.  This is from their single <em>LAST ALLIANCE</em>, and this song is titled "Boys Don't Cry".</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">More of the same, to be honest.  They do have other styles of song though.  Here's "Oto no Nai Sekai" from their album <em>Me and Your Borderline</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py82s1miBqw[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It's much more gentle, but all the same instruments.  All of their songs can usually be split into either a softer style such as this last one or the more standard rock style like the first two.  Even with a soft tone though, you still get hints of the rock creeping in around the chorus.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For the last song, it's only appropriate that I feature one of their most popular (and my favorite) song.  This is the ending for <em>Ouran Highschool Host Club</em>, "Shissou".</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">That guitar riff at the beginning gets me every time.</p>
<hr />
<p>That's it for that one, really quick and dirty.  Hope you liked it, and if you have suggestions or requests for future reviews, just put them in the comments below.  Thanks, and have a great day!</p>
