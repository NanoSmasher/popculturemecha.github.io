<p><!--more--><em><strong>**Unfortunately, there are unavoidable spoilers in this review.  The doujin </strong></em><strong>●REC <em>is very short, so I would suggest you check it out.  It is worth the time.**</em></strong></p>
<p>Please consider the following picture:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-589" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/rec.jpg" alt="rec" width="300" height="421" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now, assume that this is a cover of, let's say, a doujinshi.  Imagine what the contents of this doujin might be.  Do you have any ideas?  Good.  Keep those thoughts in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So what is <em>●REC</em> actually about?  Well, we start off with some very questionable interplay between the young girl pictured on the cover and the man sitting next to her.  Very questionable indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Alright, I'm just going to come out and say it.  We have a straight loli hentai setup right from the get go.  There are no two ways about it, the tone, coloring, and dialogue are more than a little suggestive.  For those in the know, this cover seems to be a big giveaway about the contents of the doujin.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And yet....</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I have a policy where I don't review inappropriate material.  That's just the way I am.  So why is this here?  Clearly, there is more than meets the eye.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And so we come to the crux of the issue.  What is the huge twist?  What makes this not a completely sex-filled comic?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-590" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ieku2iw.jpg" alt="ieKU2iw" width="700" height="500" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yes.  It's actually just a very bittersweet parting between a father and daughter.  That pulled at the ol' heartstrings, didn't it?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">What we have here is a classic example of literary misdirection, where what seems like one thing turns out to be completely different.  In this case, the reader is saved the experience of an awkward sexual fantasy and is instead given a heartbreaking encounter.  Would that count as a "win"?  Let's just say it is, for now.  So that I can save what's left of my dignity.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There isn't much else I can talk about with a doujin, due to it's length and content.  Besides the plot twist, there isn't much else.  The art was pretty good, and I would say that the dialogue definitely served it's purpose in titillating the audience.  The story is what comes through as the defining characteristic, which is obvious from the previous portion of this review.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Overall, the moral of this review is that you should never judge a book by it's cover, and a doujin is hardly any different.  That being said, I wouldn't pick up doujins that have similar covers to this one if I were you.  Unless you want to.  In which case, go crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yup, that about wraps it up for this review.  Hope you liked it.  It's definitely cut closer to inappropriate content than I would've liked, but I thought this doujin was worth the trouble.  Thanks for reading, and have a great day!</p>
