<p>Hi there!  Welcome to this sad place where my roam freely and without censorship (for now).  This website serves as my dumping ground for thoughts on anime/manga, comics, games, movies and tv shows.  Basically, anything to do with mass media nerd culture can be found here.  I hope to start a podcast soon that will act to supplement this thing, but I'll be putting up a bunch of posts in the meantime.  I hope you enjoy your stay, however long that might be, and feel free to leave some thoughts behind on your way out.  Have a great day!</p>
