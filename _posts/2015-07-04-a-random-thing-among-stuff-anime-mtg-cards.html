<p><!--more-->Back in the day (I'm not nearly old enough to use that turn of phrase), I played a lot of Magic: The Gathering.  For those who don't know, it's a 5 color-based card game of mystical... magic.  Yeah, I really can't make it sound cool or refined.  However, it is a widely popular card game franchise that hosts worldwide tournaments and the company that owns and operates it, Wizards of the Coast, are doing quite well for themselves, despite being one of the few parts of the game the fans dislike.</p>
<p>With that brief introduction, I present this post.  Using <a href="http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/">Magic Set Editor</a>, a software that allows you to create and customize your own MTG cards, I have a created a whole bunch of anime-based on MTG cards.</p>
<p>These cards feature, for the most part, characters whose abilities in their respective anime have been translated into the world of MTG.  However, you will also find some cards that relate more to concepts in shows rather than specific characters.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here are a bunch of anime MTG cards for your consumption.</p>
<p>[gallery columns="4" link="none" size="full" type="slideshow" ids="603,604,605,606,607,608,609,610,611,612,613,614,615,616,617,618,619,620,621,622,623,624,625,626,627,628,629,630,631,632,633,635,636,637,638,639,640,641,642,643,644,645,646,647,648,649,650,651,652,653,654,655" orderby="rand"]</p>
<p>If you are interested in more, or want to request a card, feel free to ask in the comments below.</p>
