<p><!--more--> Hi there!  This is my review for the recently cancelled procedural police show <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3487382/">Forever</a></em>.</p>
<p>Henry Morgan has lived for the past 200 years without aging a day, and he doesn't know why.  After being shot and thrown overboard in the late 1800's, he was mysteriously revived.  After that, whenever he died he would always be revived in water (without any clothes on of course).  Now, 200 years later, he works as a medical examiner at the New York City Police Department, using his unique set of skills and intimate knowledge of ancient history to solve crimes alongside Detective Jo Martinez (played by Alana De La Garza), his fellow M.E. Lucas (played by Joel David Moore) and his "adopted son" Abe (played by Judd Hirsch).</p>
<p>It's an interesting show, mixing a procedural police show with a mystery whodunit.  Not uncommon nowadays, but the finishing touch is the important part, and that is Henry Morgan and his strange affliction.  I love stories about people who have lived through history, and Henry has seen it all (check out The Man From Earth, it's rad).  He is played to perfection by Ioan Gruffudd, who captures all of the interesting and intricate details of the complex phenomena that is Morgan.</p>
<p>Overall, I liked the show and am sad to see it go.  After it was announced that it was being cancelled, many fans joined the effort to avoid it's cancellation, but sadly none bore fruit.  Everyone was really nice about the whole thing and I hope to see them in future projects.  It's a real shame that <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3487382/">Forever</a></em> didn't get the completion it so sorely needed.  Phooey.</p>

<p>Well, that's all for now folks, this is a quickie.  Thanks for reading and have a great day!</p>
