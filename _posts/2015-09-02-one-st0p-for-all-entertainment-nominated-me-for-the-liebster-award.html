<p><!--more-->Oh dear.  This was quite a while back and I'm only now getting to it.  Apologies to both of my readers (I know you're out there) for taking so long with this post.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-811" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/gin.png" alt="gin" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p>Let's get started:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/liebster.png" alt="liebster" width="200" height="199" /></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://hyugahimawariuzumaki.wordpress.com/">One St0p for all EnterTainmenT</a> for nominating me.  I didn't know anyone was actually reading this blog (but I still had blind faith that there were two followers), so it came as a surprise that I received another award nod.  Well, I can't complain.  I guess I could, but that would be insincere.</p>
<p>Here are the rules:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/rules.jpg" alt="rules" width="500" height="326" /></p>

<p><strong>4. Most annoying and an interesting anime character( Name two anime characters where in one is annoying and the other is interesting)</strong></p>
<p>I'm not good with these "think of something off the top of your head" most of the time, so I'll just say the first thing that comes to my head.</p>
<p>Most annoying: Aizen Sosuke</p>
<p>Most interesting: Ladd Russo</p>
<p><strong>5. How were you introduced to anime?</strong></p>
<p>I watched anime unknowingly when I was a kid, but the first show I watched knowing it was anime was <em>Code Geass</em> on a recommendation from a friend.  I got hooked from then on.</p>
<p><strong>6. An anime/manga character you resemble the most. (not physical features )</strong></p>
<p>Kyon.  It's rather uncanny.</p>

<p>Mystery, suspense, thriller, action... stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>8. On a range of 1-10 rate on how much you socialize with people.</strong></p>
<p>If 10 is social butterfly and 1 is "This man is an island", I'd say 4 or 5.</p>
<p><strong>9. Have you ever cosplayed?</strong></p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><strong>10. Favorite voice actor</strong></p>

<p><strong>11. Anime you have watched more than twice.</strong></p>
<p>Ah, hard question, there are a lot.  Okay, get ready.  You ready?  Ok... <em>Prince of Tennis</em>.</p>
<p>Time for some nominations.  I'm only doing 7, I need to save some nominations for the other nomination post I have to do...</p>

<p>UPDATE: Matt-in-the-hat reminded me that I'm supposed to ask 11 questions.</p>
<p><strong>1. Finish this sentence: Tomorrow is to today as Vitamin C is to...</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. If you could be a member of a Celtic folk band, what would you have your stage name be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. If you could take a hike to any part of the world (including over water), where would you go?</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Can you imagine doing something for your job than you are now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. You've just been informed that you have 3 days to live.  What are your plans?</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. If you could be the main character of anime currently running, who would you be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. After rescuing a random rich guy from falling off of a cliff (don't ask how), he asks you what you want as a reward.  What do you say?</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Your favorite pet? (ex. a breed, species, stuffed, rock)</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. Your favorite Youtube video (right now).</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. Your favorite post on your blog.</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. If you haven't already, I would recommend that you watch R.O.D. the OVA.  Do a review on it.</strong></p>
<p>I remind you, you don't need to answer any of these questions if you don't want to.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yup, that should be fine.  Thanks for reading, thanks again to <a href="https://hyugahimawariuzumaki.wordpress.com/">One St0p for all EnterTainmenT</a> for the nom, and have a great day!</p>
