<p><!--more-->Ah, another edition of "A Cry for Completion".  This time, we're talking <em>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</em> and the successful series of anime adaptations that have been released since 2012.  I'm not really going to get into the earlier OVA's that adapted the first three series of <em>Jojo's</em>.  What I'm crying about this time is the potential for future adaptations of the <em>Jojo's</em> series.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Quick history lesson</strong></span>: <em>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</em> started life as a manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki.  From 1986 to now, this manga has produced 114 tankobon volumes and counting, making it the second most prolific manga ever in terms of volume release.  Each phase of the manga deals with a generation of the Joestar family, starting with young Jonathan Joestar in 1880's Great Britain (Phantom Blood), then moving onto his grandson Joseph Joestar in 1930's New York City (Battle Tendency), and then moving onto Joseph's grandson Kujo Jotaro in 1989 Japan (Stardust Crusaders).  It continues in phases in this way for about 8 phases in total so far, the last of which is currently ongoing.  The last two volumes are actually part of an alternate timeline (Steel Ball Run and Jojolion).</p>
<p>The stories tend to deal with mysterious powers that manifest themselves in strange, or "bizarre", ways, such as the vampiric transformations of Dio Brando, one of the more significant antagonists of the show, to the familiars known as Stands that appear in Stardust Crusaders.  The art style and storytelling are rather exaggerated, with odd bodily proportions that focus on extremely muscular abdomens for the men and... well, the women are relatively normal.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what am I going on about now?  Well, I'm worried.  You see, I rather enjoyed the 2012-2105 adaptations of Phantom Blood, Battle Tendency and Stardust Crusaders, with Battle Tendency and a young Joseph Joestar voiced by Sugita Tomokazu being my favorite thing about the adaptations so far.  From what I've heard about Diamond is Unbreakable and the other sequels, I believe that I would very much enjoy further anime adaptations.  However, production of the 4th season has yet to be green-lit.  So if we do see more Jojo, it isn't going to be in the near future.  That is what worries me.</p>
<p>The anime viewing public is fickle.  If they don't get what they want as soon as possible, they will lose interest.  This prompts legal streaming sites and licensing companies to stay away from them.  They won't make money if the show they license/translate isn't popular enough.  Actually, screw profit, they won't even be able to break even.  Supporting the official release becomes impossible at that point, and Jojo will forever be relegated to the fanbase in Japan, which is huge in and of itself.  That being said... I want more Jojo!</p>
<p>Now I know what you're thinking.  "Oi, read the manga!  Plus, I'm pretty sure you're just exaggerating.  People are willing to wait for this thing.  The longer they take, the better it'll be!"  You're probably right.  I'm a pessimist by trade, and so I have a tendency towards thinking of the worst possible scenario.  To be fair, there were several hints dropped during Stardust Crusaders that pointed towards a future adaptation of Diamond is Unbreakable.  Rather than talk about it, I'll let this video explain.  Credit to Weeaboss for this.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Plus, they've had commercials out for other <em>Jojo's</em> franchise products that use the settings and characters of Diamond is Unbreakable and other phases of the series.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">So hopefully there's nothing to worry about.  Hopefully.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:left;">Thanks for putting up with more crying guys and gals.  Have a great day!</p>
