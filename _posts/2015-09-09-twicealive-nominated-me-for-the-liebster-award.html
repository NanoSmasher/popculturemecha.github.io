<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1101 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/rules.jpg" alt="rules" width="500" height="326" /></p>
<p>Here are the Q&amp;A's for this one:</p>
<p><strong>1. Are you a Ninja, or a Samurai? </strong></p>
<p>Probably a ninja, at a guess.  I would prefer to be a samurai, but I think my philosophies are more suited for ninjutsu.</p>
<p><strong>2. If you could bend any of the elements, which would it be? </strong></p>
<p>There's a time and place for each.  Can I be the Avatar please?</p>
<p><strong>3. What are the two largest factors that attract you to a show/movie? </strong></p>
<p>Atmosphere and characters.</p>
<p><strong>4. What is the highest number of books you have read within a months time? </strong></p>
<p>40.  They were pretty short books though.</p>
<p><strong>5. If you’ve ever gone on an anime marathon, how long was it? </strong></p>
<p>My record for number of episodes in one sitting is 103.  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>6. Do you like wasabi? </strong></p>
<p>It's a nasal gymastic exercise, that's for sure.  I wouldn't say I like it though.</p>
<p><strong>7. What is your favorite genre anime? Novel/manga? </strong></p>
<p>My favorite genre is probably mystery.  As for novel or manga, I'd say the same.</p>
<p><strong>8. Would you rather have a pet dragon, or pilot a mecha? </strong></p>
<p>I'd have a pet dragon for sure.</p>
<p><strong>9. What character trope annoys you the most? What character trope do you admire the most?</strong></p>
<p>Most annoying: when a girl gives up on chasing after a guy because she thinks the other two are "happier together".</p>
<p>Most admiring: cool entrances.</p>
<p><strong>10. Your a super OP secret agent, what is your code-name and where is your hideout? </strong></p>
<p>Code-name: Ed Felch.</p>
<p>Hideout: garden shed.</p>
<p><strong>11. I’ve asked this before and Ill ask it again cause its just that important: Almond butter or peanut butter? </strong></p>
<p>Peanut all the way.</p>
