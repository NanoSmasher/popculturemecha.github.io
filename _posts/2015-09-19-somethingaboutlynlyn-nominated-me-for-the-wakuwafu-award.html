<p><!--more-->...and my reign over the internet is still undisputed!  My domination of this award is just more proof.  I begin by thanking <a href="https://lynlynsays.wordpress.com/2015/09/13/wakuwafu-nominated-me-for-their-own-award/">lyn</a>.  Her continued support has cemented her position as my chief lackey.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1541" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/the.png" alt="the" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>And so now we come to this, the subject.  This newly minted award, obviously created in my honor, shall serve as a monument to my long-lasting power over the minds of the foolish internet populace.  Receiving this award is just confirmation that I will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Here are the puny rules that have been set forth:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Thank the person who has nominated you and provide a link to their blog.<br />
2. Choose any 3 things you would like to say about yourself to your fellow bloggers.<br />
3. Think up 3 questions you would like to ask the people you nominate.<br />
4. Give one piece of advice to your fellow bloggers.<br />
5. Make sure to tell us over here that you have been nominated (and/or completed the award) so that we can put your blog up on the WakuWafu page! Make sure to put down your blog in the comments section!</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to further disseminate my greatness, I shall share 3 golden factoids:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have dark brown eyes</li>
<li>Tuxedo Mask <em>was</em> my OTP</li>
<li>I love ice cream</li>
</ul>
<p>For those who are need aid in their efforts to emulate my blogging supremacy, here is a tip:</p>
<blockquote><p>Always read your stuff before posting it.  It's a matter of understanding that people will get annoyed during the reading of your stuff if a word is spelled wrong or a sentence sounds weird.  Just doing a quick read through eliminates 99.99% of bacteria- I mean clerical errors, and that can massively increase readability.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope this supports you minions.  Now, it is time to acknowledge a few other sad patrons of the interwebs.  Occasionally there are a few who deserve a second glance.  Here are just a few of them:</p>
<p><a href="https://animeandelse.wordpress.com/about/">Anime and Else</a></p>
<p><a href="https://daiyamanga.wordpress.com/about/">Daiyamanga</a></p>
<p><a href="https://dadwatchesanime.wordpress.com/about/">Dad Watches Anime</a></p>
<p>Of course, I will not just automatically administer this award.  These mites will have to jump through a few hoops, namely the following list of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do you blog?  If the reason is too personal, feel free to skip this question.</li>
<li>Who is your favorite musical act?</li>
<li>Last but not least, who is your idol?</li>
</ol>
<p>And that is all.  Return to your diminutive lives.  That will be all.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lot's of fun times.  Thanks for reading, have a great day!</p>
<p>UPDATE: lyn has reminded me that I forgot to answer her questions.  Her impertinence shall result in a reprimand and several demerits.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you follow my blog? (This is a lame question, but I couldn’t think of a better one. I am thankful that you did follow me though.)
<ol>
<li>You are right, this is a lame question.  Therefore, I shall not lower myself to answer it.  Viva la revolution!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If we were in a karaoke room, what song would we sing together?
<ol>
<li>Hello Kitty by Avril Lavigne.  I need no reason.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Do you have a favorite pick-up line? If so, what is it?
<ol>
<li>Kneel before me... please?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There, are you satisfied minion?</p>
