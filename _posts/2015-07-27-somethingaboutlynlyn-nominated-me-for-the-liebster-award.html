<p><!--more-->What?  More awards?  C'mon, buy me a drink first, I don't want you to think I'm easy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class=" wp-image-811 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/gin.png" alt="gin" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hip hip hooray for more recognition.  I have to say, I'm enjoying the traffic these awards are giving me.  It's not something I see that often, much to my chagrin.  I'd like to thank <a href="https://lynlynsays.wordpress.com/">lyn</a> right away for the nod, she's great and all that jazz.  I'm kind of in a rush (I received another nomination for this award while I was trying to write this post, so now I have to do another one), so let's keep it going.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/liebster.png" alt="liebster" width="200" height="199" /></p>
<p>And here are the rules, courtesy of <a href="https://lynlynsays.wordpress.com/">lyn</a> through <a href="https://ojitosperle.wordpress.com/">ojitosperle</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/rules.jpg" alt="rules" width="500" height="326" /></p>
<p>So let's start answering!</p>
<p><a href="https://lynlynsays.wordpress.com/">Lyn</a>'s questions:</p>
<p><strong>1. If you could describe your personality in three words, what three words would you use?  And why those words?</strong></p>
<p>"Rhythmic horror show".  What does it mean?  No idea.  I'm a fan of rhythm and I follow it like a mongoloid, I consider our world a horrific reality, and I'm ready to watch this show till my inevitable completion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do you have a pet peeve?  If so, what is it?</strong></p>
<p>People consciously ignoring me.  Man, is that annoying.  I just can't stand it when-  hey, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>3. Do you think out loud</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not limited to just thinking out loud, but yes, I do sometimes sort out my thoughts orally.</p>
<p><strong>4. Do you listen to music while you blog?  If so, what genre of music?</strong></p>
<p>Alright, my taste in music is complicated.  Suffice it to say that I listen to pretty much everything, and what I listen to at any particular time is dependent on my mood at the time.  For example, as I'm writing this post, I'm listening to this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3SlUmr_T4g[/embed]</p>
<p><strong>5. If you could make a "Soundtrack of Your Life," what five songs would you put?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, my soundtrack would need a hell of a lot more songs than that, but sure, let's stick to five.  I'm sure we all need to go to sleep at some point, so keeping it short is a good idea.  Alright, here are my five:</p>
<p>"Bridge over Troubled Water" - Simon and Garfunkel</p>
<p>"The Winner Takes It All" - ABBA</p>
<p>"Dance with God" - The Pillows</p>
<p>"L'isle joyeuse" - Claude Debussy</p>
<p>"Adieu" - Yoko Kanno</p>
<p><strong>6. Have you ever went karaoke?  Did you like it, why or why not?</strong></p>
<p>I haven't gone to a place specifically to do karaoke before, no.  I have sung in the shower, which I'm pretty sure is better.</p>
<p><strong>7. Coffee or tea?</strong></p>
<p>No thanks, I'm full.</p>
<p><b>8. Your top five favorite books of all time (well so far in life)?</b></p>
<p>All of these tough questions... alright, I'm just gonna go with stuff off of the top of my head:</p>
<p>"A Man for All Seasons" - Robert Bolt (Yes, I know it's a play.  It still counts.)</p>
<p>"1984" - George Orwell</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Monkey House" - Kurt Vonnegut</p>
<p>"Son of Interflux" - Gordon Korman</p>
<p>"Why The Future Doesn't Need Us" - Bill Joy (Yes, I know it's an article.  Stop yelling at me.)</p>
<p><strong>9. If you could rewrite the ending of a book, anime or manga?  Which would it be and why?</strong></p>
<p>I'd rewrite the ending of <em>School Days</em> so that Makoto's head ends up on a crappy boat instead.</p>
<p><strong>10. If you knew the world is going to end tomorrow, what would you do on your last day?</strong></p>
<p>I'd try and finish this post.  That, and maybe say goodbye to my friends and family.  Also, go for a walk with my iPod.</p>
<p><strong>11. Would you meet a blogger (or bloggers) in real life? If so, who and why?</strong></p>
<p>You know what?  I'd like to me <a href="https://lynlynsays.wordpress.com/">lyn</a>.  I have a feeling that we would have a lot to talk about.</p>

<p><strong>6. You take a walk in the park and encounter a bear (yes, a bear).  You reach into your pocket to defend yourself and you pull out...</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. If you could make any planet be made completely out of a single food product, which planet would it be and what would the food product be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Are you my mommy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. Give me an idea of who you would be if you were a character in an anime.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. You are part of a classic love triangle.  You encounter the two other members, the item of your affection, and your rival, in an elevator.  You have 3 choices: kiss your darling passionately, uppercut your rival, or leave the elevator.  Wait a second, you have a fourth choice, which is to...</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. And last but not least, who are you?  Please be brief.</strong></p></blockquote>
