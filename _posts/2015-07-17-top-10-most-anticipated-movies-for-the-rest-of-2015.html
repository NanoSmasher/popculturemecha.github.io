<p><!--more-->With the release of <em>Ant-Man</em> today, we've sorta come to the half-way point of the year, and so I thought it would be nice to do a survey of the movies that have yet to come out.  Here are my top 10 most anticipated movies of the rest of 2015.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#10: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Steve Jobs</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufMgQNCXy_M[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A Steve Jobs biopic didn't work out when Ashton Kutcher was the lead, but can Michael Fassbender do a better job?  He isn't a stranger to big budget projects, like the X-Men franchise, but he's also done some more low-level stuff, like <em>Frank</em>.  From the trailer, it seems like the goal of the movie is to make people hate Steve Jobs more, but I have a different theory.  I think the goal of this movie is to make a man of the legend.  Let's face it, little is actually known about the man behind Apple, as far as who he actually is as a person.  My guess is that this movie is trying to create an image of him that will act as an ode to his personality, or at least the personality Hollywood imagines him to have.  This is the ultimate milking of the Steve Jobs myth, and hopefully it gives as much as it promises with it's cast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b><u>#9: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3569230/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Legend</a></u></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI3v6KfR9Mw[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I love Tom Hardy.  After the infamous meltdown of Christian Bale, Hardy replaced him on my tier list of favorite actors.  He's been in so many iconic roles, but rarely has he taken center stage in the manner that he plans to in the upcoming film <em>Legend</em>.  Here, he takes up the role of the twin Kray brothers who ruled the London mob scene way back when.  It looks to be an action-packed combination of <em>The </em><em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> and <em>The Godfather</em>.  My expectations are high, but for some reason I have a premonition that it will disappoint.  I sure hope I'm wrong.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#8: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3682448/?ref_=cs_ov_tt">Bridge of Spies</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBBuzHrZBro[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">You really can't go wrong with Tom Hanks.  Except for maybe <em>The </em><em>Ladykillers</em>.  And <em>Road to Perdition</em> was disappointing.  Oh, <em>Larry Crowne</em> was pretty average too.  Actually, looking at his IMDB...  Alright, let me rephrase.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">You really can't go wrong with Tom Hanks, but it seems you can't go right with him either.  He's had some ups and downs from time to time.  Sure, he's called "the nicest guy in Hollywood", but the man's an actor.  It's his job to be what people think he should be.  It's a good thing he isn't considered "that guy in Hollywood who does crack and swings around chainsaws".  What were talking about again?  Oh right.  <em>Bridge of Spies</em>.  It'll probably be okay, do okay, kinda ho-hum.  I'm sure it won't be terrible.  Probably a little less impact than <em>Captain Phillips</em>, and this will translate to how it does at the box office.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#7: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1355683/?ref_=cs_ov_tt">Black Mass</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE3e3hGF2jc[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Based on the critically acclaimed book, "Black Mass: Whitey Bulger, the FBI, and a Devil's Deal", this film tells the story of White Bulger, godfather to the Irish Mob in the mid-1970's, and how he became an informant for the FBI.  I must say, I am quite surprised by how anxious I am for this movie.  Johnny Depp cuts quite a figure in the trailer and I hope he does a good job all the way through.  That hope may be a misguided one, but it's hope nonetheless.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#6: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/?ref_=cs_ov_tt">The Martian</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue4PCI0NamI[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Promising to be this year's <em>Interstellar</em>, <em>The Martian</em> tells the story of Matt Damon getting stranded on Mars after an accident during a mission.  Basically we've got a "Robinson Crusoe" or <em>Castaway-</em>type story, but this time it looks like we're seeing both the stranded and rescuing parties.  It's nothing new as far as plot is concerned, but I'm looking to strong individual performances from the main cast to pull up the picture.  That, and space porn.  Lots and lots of pretty images of space.  One word: <em>Gravity</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#5: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798684/?ref_=cs_ov_tt">Southpaw</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh2ebPxhoLs[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If we are talking great actors of the recent generations, Jake Gyllenhaal is definitely up there.  He has put out great performances as of late, in films such as <em>Prisoners</em> and <em>Nightcrawler</em>.  With <em>Southpaw</em>, I'm looking for the return of the boxing movie.  American cinema has done great things with the boxing genre, from <em>Rocky</em> to <em>Raging Bull</em> to <em>Million Dollar Baby</em>.  Each one of them required the talents of a great cast combined with a great director.  While we have a pretty decent cast here, with Gyllenhaal accompanied by Rachel McAdams and Forrest Whitaker, Antoine Fuqua is a bit hit-and-miss for my taste.  Sure, <em>Training Day</em> was amazing, but I'd say that was more a result of Denzel Washington's acting.  Meanwhile, Fuqua is also responsible for <em>Olympus Has Fallen</em> and <em>The Equalizer</em>, neither of which are the paramount of film-making by any stretch.  Be that as it may, I'm looking forward to seeing how <em>Southpaw</em> does.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#4: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1502712/?ref_=cs_ov_tt">Fantastic Four</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxIldZcUuCk[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The <em>Fantastic Four</em> reboot has my attention for 2 reasons.  First, it's a Marvel movie and I watch them all, simply for lore reasons.  Second, it will be Marvel's first test in seriously messing with the established narrative set up in the comics.  Sure, they completely abandoned the "follow the comics to the letter" approach from day one, but this is the first time we are seeing them do so with material that has already seen the silver screen.  The already released version of the Fantastic 4 maintain the relationships between team members that is well-documented in the comics.  From the look of the trailer, it seems that the direction that this movie is going to take each of the characters is going to be much different.  That, and it looks like Doom is completely different as well.  All in all, it seems that this Fantastic 4 have been molded to fit into the overarching MCU, and I am curious to see how fans of the original team will take it.  Keep in mind that the upcoming "Civil War" adaptation involves Reed Richards quite a bit.  I have a lot of faith in Miles Teller after seeing his spectacular performance in <em>Whiplash</em>, but Marvel movies are another thing altogether.  Either way, it will be quite a spectacle indeed.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#3: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951266/?ref_=cs_ov_tt">The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmYNkasYthg[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you don't know what "The Hunger Games" is at this point, then you were probably actually born yesterday.  Actually, scratch that, I'm pretty sure the nurse would've shot you the three-finger salute while lowering your head into the bath.  Seriously, this series is something like the second coming of "Harry Potter".  From text to screen, with everyone involved racking up fat stacks.  With the final part of the final installment being released in November, we'll see the end to this humongous franchise.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#2: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/?ref_=cs_ov_tt">Spectre</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ashLaclKCik[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Bond fans, rejoice.  Here's the fourth installment of the Daniel Craig Bond films.  <em>Spectre</em> looks to be a great sequel to the return to form for the franchise that was <em>Skyfall</em>.  Sam Mendes returns to the fore and it looks like smooth sailing with Javier Bardem being replaced by Christoph Waltz as the iconic Bond villain.  I'm really looking forward to seeing how this one turns out, as it looks to be more of an introspective journey for Bond, and perhaps we may get some clues regarding his past.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>#1: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/?ref_=cs_ov_tt">Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCc2v7izk8w[/embed]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Was there really any other possibility for this last entry?  This has to be here.  No matter how might the expectations are, not matter how bad it may be, <em>Star Wars</em> is the childhood of generations of people.  Out of pure loyalty, fans will line up for days to watch the heroes of their childhood stand aged next to a group of youngsters, hailing a new era for this epic story.  As you can probably tell, I grew up with <i>Star Wars</i>.  I'm also an extremely pessimistic person, and I understand that this movie is just a movie.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Despite that, I am still so hyped to see this movie.  There's just nothing I can do about it.  Even though I've raved about all of the movies on this list, I think this is the only movie I'll watch in the theater.</p>
<hr />
<p>So that's all for the list.  I hope you liked the list.  If you have any thoughts on more entries to this list, or why these entries shouldn't be here, please let me know in the comments below.  Thanks, and have a great day!</p>
