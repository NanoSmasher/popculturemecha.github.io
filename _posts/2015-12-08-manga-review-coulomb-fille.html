<p>Ah loneliness…something one can truly connect with. The desire to be with another person, the desire to talk to others, the desire to be surrounded by those you can trust. This is something we as humans can relate to intrinsically. What happens when, by natural design, we are afflicted with something that pushes away human interaction? What type of pain would you feel? That unique type of loneliness, which is what Coulomb Fille tries to give us. The story about a seaweed behemoth of a boy and a dangerous girl who is extremely electrostatic, and how both of them find the ability to be with others.</p>
<p>This story is melodramatic in its very core. Lovers torn apart by the very spark that brought them together, kind of poetic. Now don’t get me wrong, I can still consider melodramatic tales as ones with distinct amounts of value. It feels like a more unique version of “Beauty and the Beast”, but with both being afflicted with something rather than one. It knows how to handle this tale of nigh instantaneous love quite well, moving it promptly along. The love is spawned by their common desire to love people and be loved in return. The premise, characterization and character designs really play to that strength quite well.</p>
<p>If one were to look at our two main protagonists, you would call them a weird pair. They are distinct and quite memorable with quirks that have forced their personalities to shape into a certain way. Both are sheltered in their minds, never truly accepting the idea that someone would want them. The interesting part is how they are foils of one another. The boy, Kanzo, outwardly exerts his pain upon those around him. The girl, Noemi, inwardly holds in her pain as she hides from everyone in isolation. The sheer dynamic of the two is great in context, but how it is handled at times feels a bit rushed.</p>
<p>Having only 14 chapters, I really commend Coulomb Fille for doing such a great job. That being said its pacing loses it near the end of the series. The story starts to jump and the ending will not really surprise you. I was surprised at how dark the direction they took with the ending. I understand it wants to be emotional, but darker in this type of story only conflicted with its existing tone making it feel out of place. Also the ending will lead you desiring more, but there will never be more. That sense of lingering I guess you could say is ironic because of how close that feeling is towards the tale.</p>
<p>The supporting cast was not delved into as much, but still had its moments to shine. Of course the cousin Yurie becomes fan service in the beginning, but by the end of it she is quite the likeable character. This is thanks to a character arc brought on by conflicting feelings towards her cousin Kanzo. Her brother and mother were a bit shallower in their presentation and were more or less sacrificed to progress the story of our leads. The only true supporting character was Yurie in a sense as there were more subtle hints with her development rather than blatantly stating her intentions.</p>
<p>Coulomb Fille is unique, well in my years of searching through a lot of romances. If the execution of this great idea was pulled off as well as it could have been, then I would be all for putting it in my recommendation list. While I personally enjoyed it, there is a sense of mediocrity to how it was executed. Every action needed to be extravagant in order to progress the tale. This hurt the development, but also kept the tale from going stale. Like I am going to keep on saying for as long as I review, “there is a yin to every yang”. While its melodramatic tone at times will turn people off, Coulomb Fille is a pure and brisk love tale about two people trying to overcome loneliness and their unique circumstances.</p>
<p>Rating: B</p>
