<p><!--more-->Yet again we tread on towards the dusty dawn, not knowing whether this day will be our last or just our next...</p>

<p>Well, whatever.</p>
<p><a href="https://daiyamanga.wordpress.com/2015/09/16/infinity-dreams-award-2/">Daiya</a> nominated me for the Infinity Dreams Award, an award I had yet to receive a nomination for.  Thanks a lot for the support!</p>
<p>There are 2 rules for this award:</p>
<ol>
<li>List seven dreams. (They can be personal or website related.)</li>
<li>Nominate seven other bloggers/authors/dogs for this award and notify them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty simple.  Alright, how about I list the seven dreams that I wish I had, and by dreams, I'm talking about those visions you have when you're asleep:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm running from a vampire, but I'm actually watching myself run from the vampire on a chalkboard, so I'm seeing everything as if it were drawn in chalk.</li>
<li>I'm driving down the highway... I don't know how to drive.</li>
<li>It's midnight and I've just come home from something.  There's no food in the fridge, no water in the tap and no bed.  There's no house either.  Wait, where am I?</li>
<li>I'm living in a world made entirely of candy, but I'm not alone.  I spend the entire dream trying to look for other people while avoiding the strange things following me.</li>
<li>I'm skiing on lava using a rock.  Yup, that's it.</li>
<li>I'm a firetruck.</li>
<li>I'm happy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, now to nominations.  I nominate:</p>

<p><a href="https://geolisette.wordpress.com/about/">Lisette's misadventures</a></p>
