<p>Finally back to the Anime Challenge with <em>Roujin Z</em>!</p>
<p><!--more-->Yup, it's been a while since a post from me (thanks Schizoidmouse for picking up my slack).  However, I make my triumphant (half-hearted) somewhat return with this return to the Anime Challenge I started back in the summer.  The newest entry is Katsuhiro Otomo's odd commentary on the ethics of elder neglect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1718" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/roujinz1.png" alt="roujinz1" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>In the future, an excess of elderly people has resulted in such an imbalance between patients and medical professionals that the government has decided to contract out for a solution.  What they found was Roujin-Z, a high-powered, computerized bed/nurse that takes care of every need and desire.  Feeding, defecation, sleeping and communicating with their fellow elders, all is taken care of with the new Roujin-Z.  This seemingly miraculous device couldn't have come soon as far as the government is concerned and they go for it completely.  However, there is more than meets the eye when it comes to those behind the Roujin-Z project and the Ministry of Welfare have gone and enlisted an innocent old man, Takazawa Kijuro, as the test subject for the Roujin-Z project.  Unable to defend himself, it is up to his hapless but well-intentioned Mihashi Haruko to save him from being a lab rat for the rest of his short life.</p>
<p>Leave it to Katsuhiro Otomo to whip up a darkly comedic commentary on the problems inherent in elder neglect that is both absurdly weird and strangely heartwarming.  There is little more to be said about it actually, since it's a film.  So yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and have a great day!</p>
