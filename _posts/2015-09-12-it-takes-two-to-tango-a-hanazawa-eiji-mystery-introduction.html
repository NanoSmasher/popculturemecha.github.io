<p style="text-align:left;"><!--more-->Hanazawa Eiji is a genius, but has never had the guiding light to see his abilities bear fruit.  Through primary school, he found himself the subject of ridicule by the class bullies due to his shyness.  One fateful day, his parents died in a tragic accident.  Afterwards, Eiji changed.  He used his superior intellect to cause misery to all those around him, whether they were bullies or not.  By the start of high school he was almost entirely isolated from the world, the only exception being his neighbor and childhood friend Miyamoto Ami.  When strange events start occurring at the orphanage where Eiji and Ami met and became friends, Ami convinces Eiji to help solve the case.  Can Eiji overcome his past and become a person worthy of his gifts, or will he descend further into darkness dragging Ami with him?  Find out in <em>It Takes Two to Tango</em>!</p>

<p>I'm not a very good writer, but I do write a lot.  Hopefully by sheer volume, I will put out something good.  This is yet another effort with that intent in mind.  I hope you like it, but if you don't, I'm not afraid to take your criticism.  Please bring it to the fore.  I'm very new to this sort of thing and every little bit helps.</p>
<p>So let's answer some basic questions: why am I doing this, and why now?</p>
<p>About a year ago, I started getting really into Japanese literature, in particular detective fiction from various eras.  I was drawn to the similarities and differences from the film-noir pulp fiction from North America, stuff like Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett.  I'm also a big fan of mystery anime, manga... just about anything that has to do with mystery.</p>
<p>And why now?  I'm a masochist.  I'm busy at school, work and extracurriculars.  I really shouldn't any time elsewhere and this is very low on my list of priorities.  The fact that it's here at all is just a matter of me wanting to hurt myself.  Yay!</p>
<p>And so that's all for now.  This is just the intro.  I'll come out with the first chapter... when I have time.  Don't wait up.</p>
