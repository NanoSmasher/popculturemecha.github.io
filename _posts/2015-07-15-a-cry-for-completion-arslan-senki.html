<p><!--more-->Yet another new segment for the website.  Have you ever had that feeling where you saw something that you really wanted to try watching/reading, and it turns out that it has no translation or no hope of being finished in the next 5 years?  Those feelings are reason for this new segment, that I call "A Cry for Completion".  Basically, I quietly rant about an incomplete franchise, adaptation and/or translation/publication, talking about why it hasn't been completed, hopes for the future (which may end up being just empty), and my general feeling of dejection.  A very positive segment, I must say.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-760" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/farangis.png" alt="farangis" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>For this first entry, I'll talk about a show that I have been watching since last season, and have been keeping up with for <a href="http://www.seaslugteam.com/">Sea Slugs Anime Blog</a>, <em>Arslan Senki</em> or <em>The Heroic Legend of Arslan</em>.  It follows the disenfranchised prince of the Kingdom of Pars, who escapes the ruins of his homeland, and the people who follow him on his journey to seize back control of Pars and fix the mistakes of his father, the previous king.  <em>Arslan</em> is an adaptation of the ongoing series of novels of the same name by author Yoshiki Tanaka, who is better known for <em>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</em>.  When I first found that out, my expectations for later plot developments in <em>Arslan Senki</em> flew through the roofs, having seen LotGH.  Suddenly, I was more excited than I had ever been before for what <em>Arslan</em> had in store for the rest of it's run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-758" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/arslan.png" alt="arslan" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>There was only one problem.  The novels for <em>Arslan</em> have been going on since 1986.  They are currently sitting at volume 14.  With about 14 episodes of the show out as of the completion of this post, I don't see much chance of the show catching up.  Scratch that, I have no idea where the show is in terms of the novels, let alone whether it will be adapting them properly or just doing it's own thing.  I was starting to get really annoyed.  Do the people behind this show know that they will have enough money to continue further seasons of <em>Arslan</em> in the future to adapt more of the novel, or do are they just betting on the success of the show?  Do they know the progress that Tanaka-sensei is making on the novels and do they see an end in sight?  That might be why they've started an adaptation, because they know that the novels are ending soon.  Maybe they've calculated that if they start now, they will be able to do a few more seasons and be level with the novel just in time for them both to end.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-761" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/hermes.png" alt="hermes" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>All of this speculation is both useless and frustrating.  What makes it all the more painful is the fact that <em>Arslan</em> has seen his fair share of adaptations in the past, all of which never really got that far because the source material was, of course, ongoing.  First, there was a 13-volume manga back in 1991.  Then, there was the 6-episode OVA from around the same time that covered up to about volume 5 of the novels.  Then, in 2013 another manga adaptation began, drawn by Hiromu Arakawa, the guy who is best known for his work on the <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> manga.  Then, a commercial that aired during a broadcast of <em>Nanatsu no Taizai</em> announced an adaptation of Arakawa-sensei's manga, and here we are in 2015 with this adaptation of <em>Arslan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-759" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/daryun.png" alt="daryun" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>After all this time, will we see a full and complete adaptation of the original work?  That question can not be answered by me.  We can only cry, cry out for a properly done series, that respects the continuity of the epic tale, and the original work of a great author.  We can only cry for completion.</p>
<hr />
<p>That's all for this post.  I hope you liked this assessement of the <em>Arslan</em> situation and if you have any thoughts of your own on the predicament, please put them in the comments below.  Thanks, and have a great day!</p>
