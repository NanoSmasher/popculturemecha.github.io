<p><!--more-->Moving right along with "leaveit2me's Film Festival", we have one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser-known films, 1948's <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040746/">Rope</a></em>. <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040746/">Rope</a></em> tells the story of two men who commit murder to affirm their own delusions of superiority, but decide to hold a dinner party in the very room where they committed the murder and have hidden the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xkQoH8QbVs[/embed]</p>
<p>The first of the pair, Brandon, is played by John Dall.  Brandon believes that murder is not a crime, but a privilege that is reserved for only those few who are innately superior, and of course believes himself to be of that exclusive group.  The second, Philip, is played by Farley Granger.  Philip is Brandon's accomplice and is an accomplished pianist.  He goes along with the plan and commits the crime, but regrets it from then onward, denying Brandon's philosophy.</p>

<p>The movie opens with the pair murdering David Kentley, a friend of theirs from college, and then hiding the body in a chest in their living room.  They had already planned ahead and scheduled a party in that very room.  The list of guests included the deceased, his parents, his fiancee and his fiancee's ex-love interest Kenneth, another one of their friend from college.  The last guest was their old dormitory head, Rupert Cadell, played to perfection by Jimmy Stewart.  Rupert was the one who introduced Brandon and Philip to the idea of justifiable murder, and so in some twisted way Brandon feels that Rupert would appreciate what they have done.  However Brandon knows that while Rupert can talk the talk, he can't walk the walk, and for that reason he didn't invite him to join in the execution of their plan.</p>

<p>The main plot of the movie revolves around the tension that emerges as the guests start to wonder why David hasn't shown up, Philip loses his nerve, and Rupert's suspicions.  The tension builds as the party goes on and we watch as a work of art shows it's true colors to be completely human.  Hitchcock loves to play with character interactions and he is rather good at it, with <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040746/">Rope</a></em> being as good an example as any.</p>
