<p><!--more-->As if I hadn't already been nominated far too many times, it happens again.  It's just so troublesome being this popular.  Now if only my views would reflect this...</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1305" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creative-blogger-award.png" alt="creative blogger award" width="600" height="360" /></p>
<p>Well whatever.  Let's get to it, shall we?  L-Zerb from <a href="https://lzerbnaiva.wordpress.com/">Getting up Early</a> nominated me and I would like to them them for the support.  So how's about some rules!</p>
<ol>
<li>Thank the person who nominated you and include a link to their blog.</li>
<li>Share 5 facts about yourself.</li>
<li>Nominate 15 – 20 bloggers and add their links.</li>
<li>Notify the bloggers you included.</li>
<li>Keep the rules in your post to make it easy for everyone to know what to do!</li>
</ol>
<p>So now it's time for those facts right?</p>
<p>a) I only got into anime seriously in March of 2012.  However, I did watch shows earlier in my life without knowing that they were anime, shows like <em>Pokemon</em>, <em>Dragonball Z</em>, <em>Digimon</em>, <em>Yugi-Oh</em>, <em>Captain Tsubasa</em>, etc.</p>
<p>b) I wear glasses, so don't punch me in the face.</p>
<p>c) I am currently listening to a strange cocktail of <em>Radiohead</em> and <em>Modest Mouse</em>.</p>
<p>d) I'm a comedian first, an engineer second.</p>
<p>e) I recently watched <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> and <em>In the Mood For Love</em> back to back.  That was weird.</p>
<p>Okay, so... time for nominations?  This is hard... here goes nothing:</p>
