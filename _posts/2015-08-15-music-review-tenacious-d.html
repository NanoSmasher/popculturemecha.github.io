<p><!--more-->Howdy!  Time for another music review, and this time I'm doing the arch-demons of Rock 'n Roll, <em>Tenacious D</em>!</p>
<p><em>Tenacious D</em> is one of those bands that fit into the category of "novelty music" for me, for a couple of reasons.  First, they rock just a bit to hard to be taken seriously.  Often they find ways to be as extreme as possible when it comes to the content of their music and the way in which they play it, although they stay within the constraints of the rock music they adore, at least when it comes to instrumentation.  They don't have a very experimental sound, and focus more on just being as close to the soul of their style of music.</p>
<p>Second, they are caricatures from the culture they adore.  Jack Black and Kyle Gass fill their songs with sexual innuendos (if not straight-up references to having sex), false machismo as a form of self-deprecating humour, and references to rock heroes from the past.  These all combine to provide the image of an exaggerated version of the rock that many grew up listening (at least I did), with all the side-effects of drugs, music and excess of the 70's and 80's.</p>
<p>Let's get to the music shall we?  I really don't have any more to say that Jack and Kyle can't say for themselves.  Let's start with "POD" from their album <em>The Pick of Destiny</em>.</p>

<p>That's a good start.  Let's do one for their innuendo.  "Low Hanging Fruit" from <em>Rize of the Fenix</em>.</p>

<p>Alright, that's enough.  You thinking maybe a little classical?  "Classico" from <em>The Pick of Destiny</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, my favorite and arguably their best.  "Tribute" from <em>Tenacious D</em>.</p>

<p>Well that's all for now.  Thanks for reading and have a great day!</p>
